# Germany Cars Dataset Analysis

## Overview

This Java project aims to analyze the Germany Cars Dataset obtained from Kaggle. The focus is on evaluating used Volkswagen (VW) cars by investigating the relationship between mileage (KM Stand) and the car's value (price) through linear regression.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK), version 8 or later.
- An IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or any of your choice that supports Java.
- The CSV file named "Germany Cars Dataset" from Kaggle.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

2. Place the "Germany Cars Dataset" CSV file in the root directory of the cloned project or update the file path in the source code accordingly.

3. Open the project in your IDE and configure your JDK if not already done.

4. Build the project to resolve dependencies.

### Running the Application

```
make run
```

## Features

- **Data Loading:** Reads the "Germany Cars Dataset" CSV file into the Java program.
- **Data Filtering:** Filters out the dataset to include only used Volkswagen cars.
- **Linear Regression Analysis:** Performs a manual linear regression to explore the relationship between a car's mileage and its value.
- **Results Interpretation:** Outputs the linear regression equation and interprets the relationship between mileage and car value.
